# Overview#
**Geodent** is a specialized web application designed to solve the common challenge of finding suitable accommodation for university students. The platform provides a comprehensive solution where students can:
    - Browse available accommodations in or nearest their campus with transparent pricing
    - Save preferred options to a favourites list for later comparison
    - Share interesting listings with friends or roommates
    - Directly contact property agents or landlords through the platform
The application aims to streamline the often stressful process of student housing search by creating a centralised marketplace specifically tailored to the university community's needs. By focusing on transparency, user experience, and direct communication channels, Geodent helps students make informed decisions about their living arrangements while studying.

# Problem Statement #
University students consistently face significant challenges when searching for accommodations near their campuses. These challenges include:
- Limited visibility of available options in the market
- Lack of transparency in pricing and property conditions
- Difficulty in comparing multiple housing options efficiently
- Communication barriers between students and property owners
- Time constraints during academic periods to conduct comprehensive searches
These issues often result in sub-optimal housing choices, excessive costs, and unnecessary stress during an already demanding period of students' lives.

# Unlike general property listing platforms, Geodent differentiates itself through:

- **University-Centered Approach:** All listings are specifically curated for student needs and proximity to educational institutions
- **Peer Collaboration Tools:** Built-in features that facilitate roommate finding and collective decision-making
- **Verified Listings:** Properties undergo verification to ensure accuracy of information and prevent scams
- **Campus Integration:** Direct partnerships with universities to showcase university-approved accommodations
- **Student Reviews:** Authentic feedback from previous student tenants to guide decision-making

By addressing these specific student pain points, Geodent creates value beyond what generic property platforms offer, making it the preferred solution for university accommodation searches.

Geodent's target market consists of:

- **University Students:** Both domestic and international students seeking accommodation near their campuses
